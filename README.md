**About the game:**
"Tough like Putin" is a runner game that transfers the player to North Korea. The goal of the game is pretty easy to collect as many lives and coins as possible and earn achievements by reaching checkpoints.
Instructions: To play the game use mouse to click the start button on the screen. Use keyboard for movements: space for jumping and D to move the character forward. Use mouse to aim and left-click on the mouse button to shoot.

**Design process:**<br>
<img src="https://github.com/AlyonaTiki/Tough_like_Putin_game/blob/master/img/assets1.png"><br>
I entirely designed the game including background, character, and all the assets. 
Using layer over layer technique in background design I added a depth in the 2d 
image and improved the overall look of the game. I also used photos of real North 
Korean's places to achieve similarity to the actual place and make the game settings even more interesting.
The character was designed from scratch also using real photos. 
My inspiration for the style of the game was a caricature and modern 2d games. 
Graphics I created for this game is my perception and interpretation of the Russian style.

**How I built this:**
This is an HTML5 game created using JS and additional JS libraries 
like p5.js and p5.play to optimize the game development process.
