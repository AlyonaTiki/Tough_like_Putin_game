**About the game:**
"Tough like Putin" is a runner game that transfers player to the North Korea. 
The idea of the game is pretty easy to collect lives and coins as much as you 
can and earn achievements by reaching checkpoints.
Instructions: To play the game use mouse to click start button on the screen. In the game use keyboard for movements: space for jumping and D to move chracter forward. Use mouse to aim and left click on mouse button to shoot.

**Design process:**
I entirely designed the game including background, character and all the assets. 
Using layer over layer technique in background design I added a depth in the 2d 
image and improved the overall look of the game. I also used photos of real North 
Korean's places to achieve similarity to the actual place and make the game 
settings even more interesting.
The character was designed from scratch also using real photos. 
My inspiration for the style of the game was a caricature and modern 2d games. 
Graphics I created for this game is my perception and interpretation of Russian style.

**Script:**
this game is based on HTML5 and I used not only a pure JS but also additional JS libraries 
like p5.js and p5.play to optimazie the game.
